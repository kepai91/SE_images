**Terraform** is an automation tool from Hashicorp, to elegantly define, build, combine and launch infrastructure for the cloud. It provides a simple yet powerful syntax to create and compose complex, heterogeneous systems such as servers, containers and so on, which are necessary to build a product or an application, with high productivity. This helps a company to grow and evolve their infrastructure at a higher velocity.

### How it works:

Terraform uses a high-level configuration file that describes the resources that make up the infrastructure. It then generates an execution plan, which when executed builds the desired infrastructure. The execution plan gives us details about what Terraform will do to achieve the desired state. Any configuration changes are applied as incremental execution plans. In addition to the execution plan, Terraform also builds a graph of all the resources, which gives an admin a visual representation of all the resources and provides valuable insight.

### Installing Terraform:

1. Download the package for your system from [Terraform packages](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
2. Set the path variable according to your system, using the following links: for [Mac/Linux](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14637979/how-to-permanently-set-path-on-linux), for [Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1618280/where-can-i-set-path-to-make-exe-on-windows)
3. Verify installation by running the terraform on the command line.
